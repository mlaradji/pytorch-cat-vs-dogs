# Important Note

Currently, `launch.sh` and `resume.sh` are broken. They should be easily fixable, however.

## Objective

Creates an `entry.csv` that can be submitted to [Dogs vs. Cats Redux: Kernels Edition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats-redux-kernels-edition/).

## Differences from parent repository

This fork contains several differences from the parent repository. The main ones are:
- Some deprecated functionality was replaced with modern code in `main.py`. The overall output should still be the same.
- Added `copy.f`, which allows copying current data to a chosen folder in `trials/`.

## Quick-start

1. Download the data from [Dogs vs. Cats Redux: Kernels Edition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats-redux-kernels-edition/) and save to the root folder.
2. Run `prepare_data.sh` to prepare the `data` folder.
2. Run `launch.sh` after changing passed arguments to the desired values. Be sure to also look at the passed arguments in `resume.sh`.
3. It will run in the background, and will stop after an error or after the number of epochs has been reached.
4. To test the generated model, run `test.sh`.
5. To resume the program after it was stopped, run `resume.sh`.
